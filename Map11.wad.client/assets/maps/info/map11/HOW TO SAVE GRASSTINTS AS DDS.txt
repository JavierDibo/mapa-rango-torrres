Photoshop Intel Texture works plug-in: Texture Type Color, Compression: none 32bpp (Lossless, no compression)
Photoshop Nvidia dds plug-in: Format type 8.8.8.8 BGRA 32 bpp unsigned, compression quality highest
Gimp: Compression None

Everything else that can save as .dds: probably also save as uncompressed .dds or if there is no option for that 8.8.8.8
